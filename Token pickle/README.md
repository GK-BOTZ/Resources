## 🔐 Token Generator for Google OAuth (`token.pickle`)

This tool allows you to securely generate a `token.pickle` for accessing Google APIs (Drive, Gmail, YouTube, etc.) using `credentials.json`.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Google OAuth Credentials:**  
First Upload your `credentials.json` to the root of the repository.

---

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Termux (If Not Already)

Download from the official repo:  
➡️ [Termux Releases](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux)

Then open Termux and run:

--- 

``` bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install git python python-pip -y
pip install --upgrade pip
```

---

### 2. Clone This Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/TokenPickle
cd TokenPickle

Replace the dummy repo with your actual one.

---

### 3. Install Python Requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt

---


### 4. Add Your Credentials File

Move your credentials.json file into the cloned repo folder.

If it’s in your phone's Downloads folder:

cp /sdcard/Download/credentials.json ~/TokenPickle


---
### 5. Generate the Token

Run the script to start the OAuth flow:

python3 generate.py

Copy the URL shown in Termux.

Open it in a browser.

Sign in and allow access.

You’ll see:
“The authentication flow has completed. You may close this window.”



---

### 6. Download the token.pickle File

Now run a simple Python HTTP server to download the token from your mobile browser:

```
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your Android browser (like Chrome), and download token.pickle directly.



---

### ✅ Done

You’ve successfully generated and saved token.pickle.
Use it in your projects to access Google APIs without re-authenticating.

If you want me to save it as a file and give you the download link, just say `give me file`.
